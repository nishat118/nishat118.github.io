This paper presents a power-efficient complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) neural signal-recording read-out circuit for multichannel neuromodulation implants. The system includes a neural amplifier and a successive approximation register analog-to-digital converter (SAR-ADC) for recording and digitizing neural signal data to transmit to a remote receiver. The synthetic neural signal is generated using a LabVIEW myDAQ device and processed through a LabVIEW GUI. The read-out circuit is designed and fabricated in the standard 0.5 μμm CMOS process. The proposed amplifier uses a fully differential two-stage topology with a reconfigurable capacitive-resistive feedback network. The amplifier achieves 49.26 dB and 60.53 dB gain within the frequency bandwidth of 0.57–301 Hz and 0.27–12.9 kHz to record the local field potentials (LFPs) and the action potentials (APs), respectively. The amplifier maintains a noise–power tradeoff by reducing the noise efficiency factor (NEF) to 2.53. The capacitors are manually laid out using the common-centroid placement technique, which increases the linearity of the ADC. The SAR-ADC achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 45.8 dB, with a resolution of 8 bits. The ADC exhibits an effective number of bits of 7.32 at a low sampling rate of 10 ksamples/s. The total power consumption of the chip is 26.02 μμW, which makes it highly suitable for a multi-channel neural signal recording system.
