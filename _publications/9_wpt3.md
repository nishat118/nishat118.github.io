In recent years, the wireless power transfer (WPT) system has evolved tremendously as a means to deliver power to miniaturized implantable sensors. Efficiently delivering power to implants is a challenge due to the loose coupling between the transmitter and receiver coils because of the various displacements (coaxial, lateral, and angular). The coupling coefficient deteriorates significantly due to the displacements, thus decreasing the overall power transfer efficiency of the system. In this paper, we present an analysis and modeling of the effects of various displacements on the efficiency and the overall performance of a miniaturized WPT system designed for an optogenetic implant. To emulate the tissue media inside a human head, skin, skull, and gray matter layers are theoretically modeled using dielectric properties, and simulation models are developed using Ansys high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS) software. The propagation loss and the link efficiency are modeled and simula...
