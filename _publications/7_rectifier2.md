Wireless power transfer has been studied significantly in the past couple of years for implanted biomedical devices. Due to the extreme power constraints, implantable devices need efficient AC-DC power rectification. This paper presents a low-power rectifier for a wideband wireless power transfer system. The 10-stage rectifier is designed using a standard 130 nm BiCMOS process. The proposed design can rectify voltages as low as 100 mV, which is a low voltage that traditional rectifiers are not able to rectify. The rectifier has a wider frequency operation range of 10 kHz - 100 MHz compared to the previous works where the maximum operating frequency is up to 40-50 MHz. The designed rectifier is able to achieve a power conversion efficiency of 51% with 100 mV 7.25 MHz input signal, which make it highly applicable for the wireless power transfer applications for implantable sensors.
